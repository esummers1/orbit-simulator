## Orbit Simulator

A two-dimensional Newtonian physics sandbox.

Controls:
- 'o': show zoomed-in overlay
- 'z': reset zoom
- ']': cycle view forwards through entities
- '[': cycle view backwards through entities
- '.': select next available body for shooting
- ',': select previous available body for shooting
- 'c': centre view to system's centre of mass
- '=': increase drawn size of entities
- '-': decrease drawn size of entities
- 'r': reset drawn size of entities to real scale
- 'n': toggle name labels for entities
- 'a': increase time acceleration factor
- 'd': decrease time acceleration factor
- '+': increase overlay zoom factor
- '_': decrease overlay zoom factor

Click, drag and release to 'shoot' an entity into the simulation, using the currently selected body.

Use the mouse wheel to adjust the simulation display factor, i.e. zoom in and out.
