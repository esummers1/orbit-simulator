 - Finish unit tests

 - Bug: something is making bodies get rendered off-centre
   -> gets worse as entity display scale factor increases
     --> review algebra, may need to introduce this factor into scaled position
 
 - BIG FEATURE: collision mechanics for bodies that come within radius
   -> Objects combine, use combined mass and 4/3 pi ^3 to calc new radius
