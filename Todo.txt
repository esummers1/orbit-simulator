================================================================================

 - Finish unit tests
 
 - Refactor understanding of x/yVel to be an XYVector object?
 
 - Bug: something is making bodies get rendered off-centre
   -> gets worse as entity display scale factor increases
     --> review algebra, may need to introduce this factor into scaled position
 
 - Separate render loop from physics loop, e.g. render separately at 60 fps

|| Feature Ideas
================================================================================

 - Highlights or annotations for bodies so they remain visible when very small
 
 - Mousing over an area of the simulation brings up a zoomed-in overlay window
 
 - Camera view scaling mechanics
   -> Use a mouse wheel listener or keylisteners to take manual zoom inputs
   -> could also program in an automatic version but this would have tradeoffs
