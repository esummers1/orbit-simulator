 - Stop calculating scaling every draw operation; do it at object level instead?
  -> Will require doing the maths to figure how to calculate big G using the
     scale factor.

 - Expand library of pre-defined entities
 
 - Include offset when drawing each Entity, so they are centred around their
   x, y position
   
 - Finish unit tests
 
 - Create some logic to centre camera on the barycentre of all objects at each
   frame, to prevent system drifting off-screen
 
 - Dynamic resizing of simulation window depending on size of separations at
   each frame?

 - Still some strange orbit behaviour under some circumstances
