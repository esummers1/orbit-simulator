================================================================================

 - Finish unit tests; figure out strange orbit behaviours
   -> also test against real-world calculations

 - Dynamic resizing of simulation window depending on size of separations at
   each frame?
   -> complete zoom calculation
   -> work out how to best implement zoom
   -> move scale factor responsibility from Constants to Camera
 
 - Review timeStep calculation logic - should simulation speed up as framerate
   is increased...? (it doesn't)

 - Expand library of pre-defined entities
   -> come up with better way than a large number of subclasses, e.g. Entity
      class has some fields which can be populated using custom constant objs
 
 - Refactor hideous camera offset calculation code in Entity.draw()
 
 - BIG FEATURE: collision mechanics for bodies that come within radius
   -> Objects combine, use combined mass and 4/3 pi ^3 to calc new radius
