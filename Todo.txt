|| Tasks
================================================================================

 - Finish unit tests
 
 - Separate render loop from physics loop, e.g. render separately at 60 fps
 
 - Use better colour data and implement colour blending on Entity merge
 
 - Find a more generic way to handle switching Entity focus, as current imp
   only allows you to select the first 9 Entities in the simulation
    -> may need to use forward/back and find some way to not take the input
       every frame, e.g. using KeyTyped.

|| Feature Ideas
================================================================================

 - Highlights or annotations for bodies so they remain visible when very small
 
 - Mousing over an area of the simulation brings up a zoomed-in overlay window
