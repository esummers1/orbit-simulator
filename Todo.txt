|| Tasks
================================================================================

 - Finish unit tests
 
 - Refactor understanding of x/yVel to be an XYVector object?
 
 - Bug: something is making bodies get rendered off-centre
   -> gets worse as entity display scale factor increases
     --> review algebra, may need to introduce this factor into scaled position
 
 - Separate render loop from physics loop, e.g. render separately at 60 fps
 
 - Move entity rendering logic into an e.g. EntityRenderer class

|| Feature Ideas
================================================================================

 - Collision mechanics for bodies that come within radius
   -> Objects combine, use combined mass and 4/3 pi ^3 to calc new radius
 
 - Highlights or annotations for bodies so they remain visible when very small
 
 - Mousing over an area of the simulation brings up a zoomed-in overlay window
 
 - Camera view scaling mechanics
   -> Could use escape velocity calc to exclude bodies on escape trajectories
      from the CofM of all other bodies from the calculation
   -> Scale based on the largest separation of non-excluded bodies
